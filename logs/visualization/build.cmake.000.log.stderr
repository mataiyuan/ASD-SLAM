  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "maplab_common"

  Add the installation prefix of "maplab_common" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "maplab_common_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "maplab_common" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
